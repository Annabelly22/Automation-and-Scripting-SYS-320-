# Storyline: Review the Security Event Log
# Directory to save files:
SmyDir = "C: \Users\dunston\Desktop\"
# List all the
available windows Event logs
Get-EventLog -list
* Create a prompt to allow user to select the Log to view
Sreadlog = Read-host -Prompt "Please select a log to review from the list above"
# Print the results for the log
Get-EventLog -LogName sreadLog
-Newest 40 | where {S. Message -ilike "*new process has been*" } | export-csv - NoTypeInfo
-Path "SmyDir \securityLogs. CSv"
# Create a prompt that allows the user to specify a keyword or phrase to search on
$searchKeyword = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter a keyword or phrase to search for in the event logs"

# Filter the log entries based on the specified keyword
$filteredEntries = $eventLogEntries | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*$searchKeyword*" }

if ($filteredEntries.Count -gt 0) {
    # Export the filtered log entries to a CSV file
    $filteredEntries | Export-Csv -NoTypeInformation -Path "$myDir\securityLogs.csv"
    Write-Host "Filtered log entries have been saved to $myDir\securityLogs.csv"
} else {
    Write-Host "No log entries found matching the specified keyword: $searchKeyword"
}
This script will first prompt the user to select a specific Windows Event log and then prompt them to enter a keyword or phrase to search for within that log. If no entries match the keyword, it will inform the user accordingly.
